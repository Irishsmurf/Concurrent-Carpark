# Concurrent Carpark Simulation in Go

## Project Description

This project simulates a concurrent carpark using GoLang. It models the entry and exit of cars, managing parking space availability, and handling concurrent operations efficiently with goroutines and channels. The simulation aims to provide a performant and realistic representation of a carpark system.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```
bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    
```
2.  **Build the project:**
```
bash
    go build
    
```
3.  **Run the simulation:**
```
bash
    ./concurrent-carpark
    
```
This will start the carpark simulation, and you will see logs indicating cars entering and exiting the carpark.

## Dependencies

This project uses the standard Go library and has no external dependencies.
